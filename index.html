    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I am a junior at UAB studying computer science</li>
        <li>My github is <a href=https://github.com/baljeetles1>here </a> but it is underwhelming at best</li> 
        <li>Sometimes people care about my opinions of software. You can find a list of things I use/like/dislike <a href=mystuff.html>here</a> if you are into that sort of thing</li>
        <li>This website is less because I feel like I have something to offer and more as a learning exercise in HTML, CSS, and setting up and managing a server. It may also be useful to have a domain name secured for myself in the future</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Some notable things I have done</h2>
    <h3>TA</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CS250 - Discreet Structures | Graded papers and help office hours to help students understand the course material</li>
        <li>CS303 - Algorithms and Data Structures | Graded code, held office hours, and taught a lab</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This website - which is being run off of a raspberry pi 3, running raspbian and apache</li>
        <li>I am currently working on a bash script to assist in my grading. I found myself doing some very repetitive things when grading, and am hoping to automate them.</li>
    </ul>
