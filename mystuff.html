    <h1>Things I use/like/dislike</h1>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        These are things I personally use/like/dislike. Generally I prefer free software to proprietary software,
        however there will contradictions in this list I am sure. Sometimes I will use proprietary software out of pure
        ease, or school/work necessity. These things are also not endorsed by me, are not concretely the best, and are
        subject to change.
    </p>
    <h2>Things I use and like</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Computer: Some sort of dell 2 in 1 (Inspiron 13-7378 I think). However, I can count on one hand the number of times I have used it in tablet mode</li>
        <li>Desktop os: <a href=https://manjaro.org/>Manjaro </a> </li> 
        <li>Desktop environment: <a href=https://www.kde.org/>KDE</a></li>
        <li>Browser: <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/>Firefox</a></li>
        <li>Editor: <a href=https://www.vim.org/>Vim</a></li>
        <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>Markdown</a> with <a href=https://pandoc.org/>pandoc</a> to compile into pdf of html files</li>
        <li><a href=http://www.zsh.org/>Zsh</a> with <a href=https://ohmyz.sh/>oh my zsh</a></li>
        <li><a href=https://www.python.org/>Python 3</a></li>
        <li><a href=https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html>Java</a></li>
    </ul> 
    <h2>Things I like but don't use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>Emacs</a> - Similar to vim, however my only draw to it over vim is due to the work that the people over at <a href=http://spacemacs.org/>spacemacs</a> have done, and <a href=https://orgmode.org/>org mode</a></li>
        <li><a href=https://i3wm.org/>i3wm</a> - I am sure that my workflow could be optimized. It just is not comfy and feels like a chore to use. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Things I do not like but must use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>Intellij</a> - I have yet to find myself happy with using a text editor for writing java code, so I am stuck using Intellij. I think it is better than Eclipse and better than a text editor, but I am not a fan overall. I think it is the best, but still not great</li>
    </ul>
